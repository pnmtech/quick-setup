# quick-install(unstable gui)
this is a script ment to quickly setup a linux desktop install,it is mainly geared towards fedora specificaly.
i am a complete newbe how has no idea how to program so this is legitimately poorly designed and dont know if i will add any more distros.
this only has my presonal preferencess so the app selection is very bias
it also disables cpu mitigations
move the contence of the file to the home dirctory before executing it.
